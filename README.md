# Using Supervised Deep Learning to Predict Hand Sign Language
## Description
This repository contains the code used to train, test, and validate a Convolutional Neural Network that can classify hand signs. I undertook this project to better understand how to use Keras to classify images using CNNs. I leveraged my experience from this project to develop [Gesture Jester](https://github.com/mdylan2/gesture_jester).

The original notebook can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/dylanmendonca/sign-language-classifier-deep-learning).

## Data Used
The data for the project came from the MNIST. The images can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist).

## Packages Used
- Keras
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Sci Kit Learn

## Files
- `sign-language-classifier-deep-learning.ipynb`: Notebook that contains the code to build, train, test and validate the model

## Usage
1) Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/mdylan2/gesture_jester.git
```
2) Download the MNIST data from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datamunge/sign-language-mnist) and store it the appropriate directory
3) Run the notebook
